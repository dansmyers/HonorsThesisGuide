# Honors Thesis Guide

## Overview

This is a guide for students working with me to prepare an Honors thesis in computer science at Rollins College. It provides some guidelines on the thesis process, timelines, and specifications for formatting and writing your thesis document.

This guide is **opinionated**. The "rules" it contains are only my thoughts on what seems to work well; they aren't official Rollins policies or universal requirements of all thesis projects in computer science. Some of the guidelines are arbitrary, but I think it's better for first-time researchers to have more guidance and structure rather than less.

## Process

### Working

The First and Greatest Rule of Productivity: **do not binge**. You will make better progress if you work on your research in **brief, regular sessions**, rather than trying to block out one huge chunk of time per week (probably right before a meeting).

There are several reasons for this:

- It's easier to schedule and honor a small 30-60 minute block of time than to dedicate all day to one project.

- Regular sessions keep your mind engaged on the project. Taking a long break from research requires you to spend the first part of your session just remembering where you left off last time. Keeping a journal, discussed below, will also help organize your work and keep you on task.

- Brief sessions are mentally easier and less intimidating. You avoid the anxiety and perceived lack of progress that comes from scheduling four hours to work on your thesis, but only really working for less than two.

- Finally, brief, regular sessions will actually let you accumulate more time on the project than trying to binge once a week.

I recommend blocking out a window of at least 30 minutes (45 or 60 minutes is better) on each day, Monday through Friday. This is your **scheduled research time** and you **will not schedule anything else** during this block. Treat it like a class.

We'll have a scheduled meeting once per week. Working in regular sessions will ensure that you're prepared for our meetings so we can use them effectively to review what you've worked on and determine the next steps for the upcoming week.

### Getting Unstuck

If you get stuck on something, work to get yourself unstuck as soon as possible. Don't spend an entire week or more blocked and unable to make progress because of a technical issue, or because of something you don't understand and can't answer in a reasonable timeframe.

A rule of thumb: if you spend an entire daily research session stuck on one issue, let me know.

### Research Journal

You will keep a journal of your research activity each time you sit down to work on your project. Some researchers like paper journals or lab books. I use a plain text file that I type in while I work.

The journal is your log of what happened during each session. It records your progress for each day: what you did, what problems you encountered and solved, any interesting things you observed. It's also the place for you to reflect on your own research process and explore issues like what's going well, what isn't, and how you can improve the process.

The journal is not a formal document. You don't have to turn it in, although I may end up seeing it at points.

### A Daily Research Session

(This section is influenced by Robert Boice's *Nihil Nimus*. This is the approach I use in my own research sessions.)

As your scheduled research time begins, sit yourself in a place where you can be productive and focus. This is different for every person, but doing your research in the same time and place each day will help you get into a productive frame of mind.

Close your eyes, pause, and breath calmly and deeply for about 30 seconds. Don't dwell on conscious thoughts. If any emerge, just let them go and return your focus to your breathing. This brief meditation centers you and creates a separation between your activities before the research session and the work of the session itself.

You're now ready to begin.

Open your journal and make a heading for today. Spend a few minutes free writing about the project: what you did last time, what you need to do today, what open questions exist, even what you're enjoying about the project and want to study in more detail. Keep it free and don't edit yourself. This exercise helps you reengage with the state of the project.

Now dive in and work on your tasks for today. As you tackle each task, make a note of what you are doing. If you try something and it doesn't work, make a note of that, then note what you're trying next. As you obtain results, you'll also log those in the journal.

Take a break if you need to, but resist the temptation to visit social media or Internet sites that aren't directly relevant to your project. You can sustain your focus for 40 minutes and the constant reflective journaling activity will help keep you engaged.

When you reach the end of your time, or a natural stopping place, pause for a moment before concluding. Free write for a few more lines about what you did today and what you think you need to do next.

Finally, **write down one to four tasks**, in order of priority, for the next session. This is your to-do list. When you come back next time, you'll tackle these tasks, with the highest priority one coming first. If a task seems too large, just break it into subtasks, then prioritize those.
